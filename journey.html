									<h3 class="major">Undergraduate Education</h3>
									<p>In December 2021, I graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a B.S. in Biological Sciences. I love efficiency, and therefore I worked hard to graduate two quarters early so I could continue furthering my education in medical school as quickly as possible. I wanted to quickly become a doctor without wasting any time getting there. I ended up graduating with a 3.85 GPA and High Honors (Magna Cum Laude), which meant that I was in the top 8.5% of students at graduation. </p>

									<h3 class="major">Post-Grad</h3>
									<p>After graduation, things were looking pretty great for me and my path to becoming a doctor. I was ahead of schedule in terms of getting my degree, had great letters of recommendation from my professors ready to go, and had a great GPA. All I needed now was to take the MCAT and then I would be ready to apply to medical schools. While studying for the MCAT, I decided to take an online, introductory computer science course called CS50 at Harvard out of curiosity for the field of computer science and a personal love of computers. This decision ended up changing everything.</p>

									<h3 class="major">CS50</h3>
									<p>While studying for both the MCAT and CS50, I found myself slowly spending more and more time on CS50 and less time on MCAT preparation. Before I knew it, I realized that I was actually looking forward to my next CS50 lecture and homework right after completing the current one. In CS50, the problems I was solving and the projects I was creating were unlike anything I had ever done before. I actually had to use critical thinking and problem solving to slowly break down bigger challenges into smaller, simpler ones. This was very different than the simple memorization of concepts required for biology and the MCAT. For the first time in my life, I actually wanted to spend my free time studying. It felt like I was solving fun puzzles rather than doing work. Thats when I knew I loved coding.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Career Change</h3>
									<p>After realizing my love for software engineering, I decided to give up on medical school and switch careers. To continue my education, I first took two data structures and algorithms classes at UC Berkeley (CS61A/CS61B), where I learned the real fundamentals of computer science. Then I started to learn and master new languages such as python, javascript, and react through free online courses and resources. Finally, I began building my portfolio by creating bigger projects that I could share with the world. Today, I am now working on even larger projects while also searching for new opportunities as a software engineer. </p>
